    "#Problem\n",
    "#A sequence is an ordered collection of objects (usually numbers), which are allowed to repeat. Sequences can be finite or infinite.\n",
    "#Two examples are the finite sequence (π,−2–√,0,π) and the infinite sequence of odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9,…).\n",
    "#We use the notation an to represent the n-th term of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#A recurrence relation is a way of defining the terms of a sequence with respect to the values of previous terms.\n",
    "#In the case of Fibonacci's rabbits from the introduction, any given month will contain the rabbits that were alive the previous month, plus any new offspring.\n",
    "#A key observation is that the number of offspring in any month is equal to the number of rabbits that were alive two months prior.\n",
    "#As a result, if Fn represents the number of rabbit pairs alive after the n-th month,\n",
    "#then we obtain the Fibonacci sequence having terms Fn that are defined by the recurrence relation Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2 (with F1=F2=1 to initiate the sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "#When finding the n-th term of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation,\n",
    "#we can simply use the recurrence relation to generate terms for progressively larger values of n.\n",
    "#This problem introduces us to the computational technique of dynamic programming,\n",
    "#which successively builds up solutions by using the answers to smaller cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months,\n",
    "#if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation,\n",
    "#every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of krabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair)."
